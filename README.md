# Expense Application – Ansible Automation

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and configurations to automate the deployment and management of a complete Expense Tracking Application stack, including Frontend, Backend, and Database (MySQL) components.

It is designed to provide repeatable, consistent, and scalable deployments across Linux servers using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

# Key Features

Automated deployment using Ansible

Separate playbooks for frontend, backend, and database

Systemd-based service management

Centralized inventory-driven configuration

Idempotent execution for safe re-runs

Suitable for Dev / QA / Prod environments

# Architecture Overview
# User
#  |
#  v
# Frontend (Nginx / Web UI)
#  |
#  v
# Backend API (Systemd Service)
#  |
#  v
# MySQL Database


Frontend serves the UI and forwards requests to backend

Backend processes business logic and connects to MySQL

MySQL stores expense data

All components are provisioned and managed via Ansible playbooks

# Prerequisites

Ensure the following before execution:

Linux-based control node

Ansible installed

SSH key-based authentication to managed hosts

Python installed on target machines

Sudo privileges on target servers

Install Ansible
sudo yum install ansible -y
# or
pip install ansible

# Usage & Execution Flow
# 1️. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/RajGitUser/expense_application.git
cd expense_application

# 2️. Configure Inventory

Edit inventory.ini:

[frontend]
frontend ansible_host=FRONTEND_IP

[backend]
backend ansible_host=BACKEND_IP

[database]
mysql ansible_host=DB_IP

# 3️ Recommended Execution Order

⚠️ Always follow this order for a clean deployment

🔹 Base Server Setup
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini 01_ec2_server.yaml

🔹 MySQL Database
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mysql.yaml

🔹 Backend Service
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini backend.yaml

🔹 Frontend
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini frontend.yaml

🔹 OS Patching (Optional)
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini patching.yaml

systemctl restart backend
systemctl enable backend
